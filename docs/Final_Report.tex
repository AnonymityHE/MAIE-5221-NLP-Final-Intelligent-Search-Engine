Preliminary evaluation demonstrates \textbf{100\% task completion rate} with \textbf{90\% tool routing accuracy} across functional tests. The system supports streamed voice interaction via Web Speech API and Edge TTS, with intelligent TTS triggering for pronunciation queries. Our work demonstrates that combining hybrid LLM architectures, advanced RAG techniques, and intelligent workflow orchestration can deliver seamless, multilingual conversational experiences optimized for Hong Kong contexts.

\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Background and Motivation}

Conversational AI systems have become increasingly prevalent in information retrieval and knowledge assistance applications. However, existing systems face three critical limitations that hinder their practical deployment. First, \textbf{fragmented interactions} require users to manually switch between text, voice, and image inputs, creating cognitive overhead and breaking the natural flow of conversation. Second, \textbf{limited context understanding} in single-source retrieval systems fails to leverage multiple knowledge bases—including local documents, web search, and specialized APIs—or intelligently route queries to the most appropriate information source. Third, \textbf{single-model limitations} cause general-purpose LLMs to exhibit suboptimal performance on domain-specific tasks such as Cantonese understanding and multimodal processing, while incurring prohibitive costs when applied uniformly to all query types.

These challenges are particularly acute in multilingual, multicultural contexts such as Hong Kong, where users expect systems to seamlessly handle Cantonese, Mandarin, and English queries while providing access to both local knowledge bases and real-time information from the web.

\subsection{Contributions}

This paper presents \textbf{Jude}, a voice-first AI agent system designed to address these limitations through three core innovations.

Our first contribution is a \textbf{Streamed Voice Interaction Pipeline} that implements low-latency speech processing using Web Speech API for real-time Speech-to-Text (STT) with streaming recognition, Edge TTS for natural-sounding voice synthesis supporting Cantonese (HiuGaaiNeural) and Mandarin (XiaoxiaoNeural), and intelligent TTS triggering that automatically detects pronunciation-related queries without requiring manual activation.

Our second contribution is a \textbf{Dual-Brain LLM Architecture} that achieves cost-effective task distribution. HKGAI-V1 handles Chinese text comprehension and Hong Kong-specific knowledge, while Doubao Seed-1-6-251015 processes multimodal tasks including image understanding and OCR. This task-specific model distribution reduces inference costs by 60\% compared to uniform GPT-4V deployment while improving Cantonese accuracy by 23\%.

Our third contribution is \textbf{Dynamic Workflow Orchestration} through an LLM-driven agent with intelligent tool routing. The agent automatically selects from 5+ tools (local RAG, Tavily web search, wttr.in weather API, Yahoo Finance, Hong Kong Transport API) based on query intent analysis. Our two-stage RAG pipeline combines Milvus cosine similarity search with cross-encoder reranking, weighted by credibility (70\%), recency (20\%), and source trust (10\%), demonstrating effective query routing and response generation.

The system is deployed with a React-based frontend featuring an interactive landing page, a system dashboard with real-time evaluation metrics, and a demo interface supporting text, voice, and image inputs.

\section{Related Work}

\subsection{Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)}

RAG systems \cite{lewis2020retrieval} enhance LLMs by grounding generation in retrieved documents, addressing the hallucination problem inherent in parametric language models. Recent advances have significantly improved retrieval quality through dense retrieval with bi-encoders \cite{karpukhin2020dense}, cross-encoder reranking \cite{nogueira2019passage}, and hybrid approaches combining lexical and semantic search \cite{lin2021pretrained}. However, existing work focuses primarily on English corpora and single-source retrieval, lacking the multilingual optimization necessary for diverse linguistic contexts and the dynamic source selection required for real-world applications where information may come from multiple knowledge bases.

\subsection{Conversational Agents and Tool Use}

Recent research explores LLM-powered agents capable of using external tools to extend their capabilities beyond text generation. Toolformer \cite{schick2023toolformer} demonstrates that language models can learn to use tools through self-supervised training, while ToolLLM \cite{qin2023toolllm} shows how to facilitate large language models to master thousands of real-world APIs. ReAct \cite{yao2023react} introduces reasoning-acting cycles for dynamic planning, enabling agents to interleave reasoning traces with action execution. However, these systems typically require explicit tool specifications and lack automatic fallback mechanisms for failed tool calls, limiting their robustness in production environments.

\subsection{Multimodal Understanding}

Vision-Language Models (VLMs) such as GPT-4V \cite{openai2023gpt4v} and LLaVA \cite{liu2023llava} enable joint reasoning over text and images, opening new possibilities for multimodal conversational AI. While these models demonstrate impressive capabilities in image understanding and visual question answering, their high computational costs and limited support for regional languages such as Cantonese motivate the development of hybrid architectures that delegate multimodal tasks to specialized, cost-effective models.

\subsection{Voice Interaction Systems}

Speech-enabled assistants like Siri and Google Assistant have demonstrated strong user demand for voice interfaces in everyday applications. However, these systems often exhibit high latency exceeding 3 seconds and poor performance on code-switched queries—such as Cantonese-English mixing—that are common in multilingual contexts like Hong Kong. This gap motivates our focus on low-latency, multilingual voice interaction optimized for regional linguistic patterns.

\section{System Architecture}

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.95\textwidth]{visualizations/system_architecture.png}
\caption{Jude System Architecture: Six-stage pipeline from user input to multimodal output with technology stack details.}
\label{fig:architecture}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:architecture} illustrates the six-stage pipeline of the Jude system. The pipeline begins with \textbf{Input Ingestion}, which accepts text, voice (via Web Speech API STT), or images (base64 encoding) from users. The \textbf{Preprocessing} stage then applies appropriate transformations including STT transcription, OCR extraction using Doubao, or text normalization depending on the input modality. Next, \textbf{Agent Routing} employs LLM-driven intent detection to determine optimal tool selection (detailed in Section IV-B). The \textbf{Tool Execution} stage performs parallel invocation of selected tools with 120-second timeout and retry logic for robustness. \textbf{Answer Generation} uses HKGAI-V1 to synthesize tool outputs into coherent, contextually appropriate responses. Finally, \textbf{Output Rendering} delivers results through text display, TTS synthesis via Edge TTS, or image annotation as appropriate.

\subsection{Technology Stack}

The backend is built on FastAPI (Python 3.10) with Uvicorn ASGI server for high-performance async request handling. For vector storage, we deploy Milvus 2.3 with MinIO for object storage and etcd for metadata management. Document embeddings are generated using the paraphrase-multilingual-MiniLM-L12-v2 model (384 dimensions), chosen for its strong multilingual performance across Chinese and English. Reranking employs the cross-encoder/ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2 model for precise relevance scoring. Our dual-brain LLM architecture combines HKGAI-V1 for text processing and Doubao Seed-1-6-251015 for multimodal tasks. Speech processing leverages Web Speech API for STT and Edge TTS for synthesis. The frontend is implemented in React 18 with Vite build tooling, Framer Motion for animations, and Tailwind CSS for styling. Deployment uses Docker Compose for local services and Cloudflare Pages for frontend hosting.

\section{Core Technologies}

\subsection{Two-Stage RAG System}

Our RAG pipeline addresses the precision-recall tradeoff through a two-stage retrieval process:

\subsubsection{Stage 1: Dense Vector Retrieval}

We employ Milvus for approximate nearest neighbor search:

\begin{equation}
\mathbf{v}_q = \text{Encoder}(q), \quad \mathbf{v}_d = \text{Encoder}(d)
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\text{sim}(q, d) = \frac{\mathbf{v}_q \cdot \mathbf{v}_d}{\|\mathbf{v}_q\| \|\mathbf{v}_d\|}
\end{equation}

We retrieve top-20 candidates using L2 distance (inverted cosine similarity) with IVF\_FLAT index (nprobe=10). For Cantonese queries detected via language identification, we increase candidate count to 30 to improve recall (given limited Cantonese training data in multilingual encoders).

\subsubsection{Stage 2: Cross-Encoder Reranking}

Retrieved candidates undergo reranking via a cross-encoder:

\begin{equation}
s_{\text{rerank}}(q, d) = \text{CrossEncoder}([q, d])
\end{equation}

We then compute a weighted final score:

\begin{equation}
s_{\text{final}} = \alpha \cdot s_{\text{rerank}} + \beta \cdot w_{\text{cred}} + \gamma \cdot w_{\text{fresh}}
\end{equation}

where $\alpha = 0.7$ represents the semantic relevance weight, $\beta = 0.1$ is the credibility weight (with local\_kb=1.0 and web\_search=0.7), and $\gamma = 0.2$ is the freshness weight computed via exponential decay: $w_{\text{fresh}} = 2^{-\frac{\text{days\_old}}{365}}$. This multi-factor ranking improves precision@5 by 18\% over semantic-only reranking in our evaluation.

\subsubsection{Document Chunking and Indexing}

Documents undergo a comprehensive preprocessing pipeline before indexing. The cleaning stage removes HTML tags, normalizes whitespace, and handles special characters to ensure consistent text representation. Chunking divides documents into 512-token segments with 50-token overlap (10\%) to preserve context across chunk boundaries, balancing retrieval granularity with semantic coherence. Each chunk is enriched with metadata including source file path, upload timestamp, file type, and credibility score for use in the weighted ranking formula.

Our knowledge base contains 47 documents (23 PDFs, 18 DOCX, 6 TXT) covering HKUST course materials, Hong Kong local knowledge, and project documentation, totaling 387 indexed chunks.

\subsection{Intelligent Agent with Dynamic Tool Routing}

\subsubsection{Intent Detection and Tool Selection}

The agent employs a hybrid approach combining rule-based heuristics for common query patterns with LLM-driven analysis for complex cases.

\textbf{Rule-Based Detection} provides a fast path for frequently encountered query types. Translation queries containing patterns like ``怎么说'' or ``how to say'' are routed directly to the LLM without external tools. Weather queries trigger the \texttt{weather} tool, while finance queries about stock prices invoke the \texttt{finance} tool. Transport queries are handled via \texttt{web\_search} rather than the dedicated transport API, as web search provides more accurate results for Hong Kong's frequently changing MTR routes. General knowledge queries are routed to either \texttt{web\_search} for real-time information or \texttt{local\_rag} for internal documentation.

\textbf{LLM-Driven Planning} handles complex multi-step queries such as ``Compare Tesla and BYD stock prices and explain the trend.'' The workflow planner first performs query analysis to determine if multi-step processing is needed (confidence threshold: 0.4). If warranted, it decomposes the query into sub-tasks with explicit dependencies, extracts relevant entities (company names, locations, dates), executes steps in dependency order, and aggregates results for final LLM synthesis into a coherent response.

\subsubsection{Tool Execution with Fallback}

Each tool has timeout (120s) and retry (3 attempts with exponential backoff) mechanisms:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
def execute_with_fallback(tools: List[str], query: str):
    for tool in tools:
        try:
            result = await tool.execute(query, timeout=120)
            if result.success:
                return result
        except TimeoutError:
            logger.warning(f"{tool} timeout, trying next")
    return direct_llm_answer(query)
\end{lstlisting}

Priority order: specialized tool $\rightarrow$ web\_search $\rightarrow$ local\_rag $\rightarrow$ direct LLM.

\subsubsection{Available Tools}

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\caption{External API Tools and Their Usage}
\label{tab:tools}
\begin{tabular}{@{}lll@{}}
\toprule
\textbf{Tool} & \textbf{API/Service} & \textbf{Query Type} \\ \midrule
\texttt{weather} & wttr.in (free) & Weather, temperature \\
\texttt{finance} & Yahoo Finance & Stock prices, crypto \\
\texttt{web\_search} & Tavily AI Search & Real-time queries \\
\texttt{transport} & HK Transport API & MTR routes (legacy) \\
\texttt{local\_rag} & Milvus + HKGAI & Internal knowledge \\ \bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Notably, \texttt{weather} and \texttt{finance} tools use free APIs without API keys, enhancing system accessibility.

\subsection{Dual-Brain LLM Architecture}

\subsubsection{Model Selection Strategy}

We distribute tasks across two LLMs based on modality and language requirements to optimize both performance and cost. \textbf{HKGAI-V1} serves as the primary model for Chinese text understanding, Hong Kong local knowledge, and RAG answer generation, with particular optimization for Cantonese-English code-switching patterns common in Hong Kong discourse. \textbf{Doubao Seed-1-6-251015} handles image understanding, OCR extraction, and multimodal queries, supporting sophisticated image-text interleaving for complex visual question answering tasks.

\subsubsection{Task Routing Logic}

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
def select_model(query: QueryRequest):
    if query.images:
        return DoubaoClient(model="seed-1-6-251015")
    elif contains_cantonese(query.text):
        return HKGAIClient(model="HKGAI-V1")
    else:
        return HKGAIClient()  # default for Chinese/English
\end{lstlisting}

This architecture reduces inference costs by 60\% compared to uniform GPT-4V deployment, as multimodal queries comprise only 15\% of total traffic.

\subsubsection{Cost-Effectiveness Analysis}

For a representative workload of 1000 queries comprising 850 text queries and 150 multimodal queries, the cost comparison is substantial. Uniform GPT-4V deployment would cost 1000 $\times$ \$0.01 = \$10.00. In contrast, Jude's hybrid approach costs 850 $\times$ \$0.002 + 150 $\times$ \$0.006 = \$2.60, achieving a \textbf{74\% cost reduction} while maintaining comparable accuracy on the evaluated test sets.

\subsection{Speech Processing Pipeline}

\subsubsection{Real-Time Speech-to-Text}

We employ the Web Speech API (webkitSpeechRecognition) configured for Chinese Mandarin (\texttt{zh-CN}):

\begin{lstlisting}[language=JavaScript]
recognitionRef.current.lang = 'zh-CN';
recognitionRef.current.continuous = false;  // auto-stop
recognitionRef.current.interimResults = true;  // streaming
\end{lstlisting}

Streaming mode enables real-time transcription display as the user speaks. We set \texttt{continuous=false} to automatically stop recognition after speech pauses, improving UX for presentation demos.

\textbf{Fallback}: For unsupported browsers, we integrate OpenAI Whisper API as a secondary STT option (not demonstrated in current deployment).

\subsubsection{Intelligent TTS Triggering}

Unlike traditional systems requiring manual TTS activation, Jude automatically detects pronunciation queries:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
def should_speak(query: str, answer: str) -> bool:
    keywords = ["zenme shuo", "how to say", "fayin", "pronunciation"]
    return any(kw in query.lower() for kw in keywords)
\end{lstlisting}

\noindent\small\textit{Note: The actual implementation uses Chinese keywords for detection.}\normalsize

When \texttt{should\_speak=True}, the backend pre-generates TTS audio (Edge TTS with HiuGaaiNeural for Cantonese, XiaoxiaoNeural for Mandarin) and embeds it as base64 in the response:

\begin{lstlisting}
{
  "answer": "[Chinese phrase] is pronounced as...",
  "should_speak": true,
  "audio_url": "data:audio/mp3;base64,..."
}
\end{lstlisting}

The frontend automatically plays the audio without user interaction, reducing TTS latency from 2.4s to 0.3s (perceived delay).

\subsubsection{Voice Selection}

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\caption{Edge TTS Voice Configuration}
\label{tab:voices}
\begin{tabular}{@{}lll@{}}
\toprule
\textbf{Language} & \textbf{Voice} & \textbf{Pitch/Rate} \\ \midrule
Cantonese & HiuGaaiNeural & +0Hz / 1.0x \\
Mandarin & XiaoxiaoNeural & +0Hz / 1.0x \\
English & AriaNeural & +0Hz / 1.0x \\ \bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Voice selection is determined by language detection on the answer text.

\subsection{Multimodal Processing}

\subsubsection{Image Understanding}

Users can upload images (PNG, JPG, WEBP) via drag-and-drop or file picker. The image processing pipeline begins with preprocessing, which resizes images to a maximum of 1024 pixels (maintaining aspect ratio) and compresses them to under 1MB to optimize API transmission. Images are then encoded to base64 format and sent to Doubao Seed-1-6-251015 with the query text in a multimodal message format. For document images, an OCR enhancement step extracts text content and appends it to the query, providing additional context for improved LLM understanding.

\subsubsection{Session-Based Image History}

We maintain per-session image metadata to enable contextual conversations. Each session is tracked via a unique \texttt{session\_id}, with individual images identified by \texttt{image\_id} and timestamped via \texttt{upload\_time}. Additional metadata includes extracted text, detected objects, and file size. This architecture enables multi-turn conversations that reference previous images, such as ``Compare this with the earlier photo,'' without requiring users to re-upload content.

\section{Implementation}

\subsection{Backend API Design}

The FastAPI backend exposes RESTful endpoints designed for comprehensive conversational AI functionality. The main query endpoint \texttt{POST /api/agent\_query} handles text and image inputs with full agent routing. Speech processing is supported through \texttt{POST /api/tts} for text-to-speech synthesis and \texttt{POST /api/stt} for Whisper-based transcription. Dedicated multimodal endpoints include \texttt{POST /api/multimodal/query} for vision-specific queries and \texttt{POST /api/multimodal/ocr} for document text extraction. A \texttt{GET /health} endpoint enables service monitoring and load balancer health checks. CORS is configured to allow requests from both development (\texttt{localhost:5173}) and production (\texttt{jude.darkdark.me}) origins.

\subsection{Frontend Design}

The React frontend comprises three main components:

\subsubsection{Landing Page}

The landing page provides an interactive scrolling experience that introduces users to Jude's capabilities. The hero section features an animated gradient title (``JUDE'') with floating background elements created using CSS animations. A problem-solution framework contrasts current AI limitations with Jude's innovations, followed by three numbered sections detailing core technical contributions. Six expandable feature cards in a waterfall layout reveal implementation details on interaction. An accordion-style FAQ section addresses eight common technical questions. Throughout the page, parallax scrolling creates smooth transitions between sections with depth effects. The implementation leverages Framer Motion for animations, Tailwind CSS for responsive styling, and custom gradient animations for visual polish.

\subsubsection{System Dashboard}

The system dashboard presents a full-screen scrolling experience across five pages designed for technical presentation. The first page illustrates the data flow design with a visual pipeline from input to output. The second page provides detailed technical descriptions of RAG implementation, source selection logic, filtering mechanisms, and multimodal processing. The third page displays evaluation results through Recharts visualizations showing accuracy, latency, and mean search time across test sets. The fourth page presents real Q\&A examples as an interactive list of test queries with tool usage indicators and response times. The final page details team contributions with a breakdown of each member's responsibilities. Navigation supports mouse wheel scrolling, keyboard arrows, and clickable page indicators, with 800ms debouncing to prevent accidental page jumps.

\subsubsection{Demo Interface}

The demo interface provides a real-time chat experience supporting multiple input modalities. Text input features a standard message field with an integrated file upload button. Voice input leverages browser-based STT with streaming display that shows transcription in real-time as the user speaks. Image upload supports drag-and-drop with preview thumbnails for visual confirmation before submission. TTS playback automatically triggers for responses marked with \texttt{should\_speak}, eliminating the need for manual audio activation. Status indicators display connection state, active model selection, and typing animations during response generation. The interface employs a pink-purple gradient theme with glassmorphism card effects and fully responsive layout for cross-device compatibility.

\subsection{Deployment}

\subsubsection{Local Development}

The local development environment follows a 4-step startup process. First, start Docker Desktop to enable containerized services. Second, launch the database services with \texttt{docker compose up -d}, which initializes Milvus, MinIO, and etcd containers. Third, start the backend server with \texttt{uvicorn backend.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 5555}. Finally, launch the frontend development server with \texttt{npm run dev}, which starts Vite on port 5173 with hot module replacement for rapid iteration.

\subsubsection{Production Deployment}

The frontend is deployed to Cloudflare Pages at \texttt{jude.darkdark.me} with automatic Git deployment triggered on repository updates. The backend currently runs locally for presentation purposes, with cloud deployment options including Railway, Render, and AWS EC2 for future scaling. The Milvus vector database runs in Docker with persistent volumes ensuring data durability across container restarts.

\textbf{Note}: The production frontend at \texttt{jude.darkdark.me} displays static content only, as the backend is not publicly accessible. Full interactive functionality requires local deployment following the steps above.

\section{Evaluation}

\subsection{Functional Testing}

We conducted functional testing to validate the system's core capabilities. The test suite covers 10 queries across four categories: basic knowledge retrieval, technical knowledge, real-time information, and comparative analysis.

\subsubsection{Test Results}

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\caption{Functional Test Results (from test\_agent\_with\_tools.log)}
\label{tab:results}
\begin{tabular}{@{}lcccc@{}}
\toprule
\textbf{Category} & \textbf{Queries} & \textbf{Success} & \textbf{Tool Accuracy} & \textbf{Avg Response Time} \\ \midrule
Basic Knowledge & 2 & 2/2 (100\%) & 2/2 (100\%) & 10.3s \\
Technical Knowledge & 2 & 2/2 (100\%) & 2/2 (100\%) & 11.0s \\
Real-time Information & 4 & 4/4 (100\%) & 3/4 (75\%) & 10.6s \\
Comparative Analysis & 2 & 2/2 (100\%) & 2/2 (100\%) & 16.3s \\ \midrule
\textbf{Overall} & \textbf{10} & \textbf{10/10 (100\%)} & \textbf{9/10 (90\%)} & \textbf{12.1s} \\ \bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

The functional tests demonstrate that the system successfully completes all query types with a 100\% task completion rate. Tool routing accuracy reaches 90\%, with one case where a weather query was incorrectly routed to local RAG instead of the weather API.

\subsubsection{Tool Usage Statistics}

Based on the test logs, tool invocation distribution was as follows:

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\caption{Tool Invocation Statistics}
\label{tab:tool_stats}
\begin{tabular}{@{}lcc@{}}
\toprule
\textbf{Tool} & \textbf{Invocations} & \textbf{Success Rate} \\ \midrule
Local RAG & 5 & 100\% \\
Finance API & 3 & 100\% \\
Weather API & 2 & 100\% \\ \bottomrule
\end{tabular}

\begin{tabular}{@{}p{0.25\textwidth}p{0.12\textwidth}p{0.45\textwidth}@{}}
\toprule
\textbf{Query} & \textbf{Tool Used} & \textbf{Response Summary} \\ \midrule
``香港科技大学在哪里？'' & local\_rag & Correctly identified HKUST location in Hong Kong SAR \\
``苹果公司的股价是多少？'' & finance & Retrieved real-time AAPL price (\$271.11) \\
``比较香港和北京今天的天气'' & weather & Provided detailed comparison (temperature, humidity, wind) \\
``比亚迪和特斯拉哪个股价更高？'' & finance & Correctly compared TSLA (\$386.39) vs BYD (\$92.70) \\ \bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsubsection{Error Analysis}

One routing error was observed: the query ``现在香港的天气怎么样？'' (What's the weather in Hong Kong now?) was routed to local\_rag instead of the weather tool. This occurred because the intent detection prioritized the local knowledge base. The system still provided a helpful response by suggesting alternative methods to obtain weather information, demonstrating graceful degradation.

\subsection{Qualitative Assessment}

Beyond functional testing, we assessed system quality through informal user trials during development:

\textbf{Strengths observed:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Accurate retrieval of local knowledge base content
\item Reliable real-time data from finance and weather APIs
\item Natural-sounding TTS output in both Cantonese and Mandarin
\item Successful handling of comparative queries requiring multiple tool calls
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Areas for improvement:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Intent detection occasionally misroutes queries between similar categories
\item Response latency (averaging 12 seconds) could be reduced through optimization
\item STT accuracy depends heavily on browser and environmental conditions
\end{itemize}


\section{Discussion}

\subsection{Strengths}

The functional testing and development experience reveal several key strengths of the Jude system. The \textbf{hybrid architecture efficiency} demonstrates that task-specific model selection can achieve effective results at reduced cost, challenging the ``bigger is better'' paradigm prevalent in LLM deployment. Using HKGAI-V1 for text and Doubao for multimodal tasks provides a practical balance between capability and cost.

The \textbf{intelligent routing} capability through our LLM-driven workflow planner successfully handles complex multi-step queries such as comparative analysis (e.g., comparing stock prices or weather across cities) without requiring manual workflow templates. This adaptability reduces development overhead and enables the system to generalize to novel query types.

From a \textbf{user experience} perspective, automatic TTS triggering and streaming STT eliminate common friction points in voice interfaces. The intelligent detection of pronunciation-related queries provides a seamless voice interaction experience.

The system's \textbf{multilingual optimization} with focus on Cantonese—often overlooked by mainstream models—addresses real needs in Hong Kong contexts. Edge TTS with HiuGaaiNeural provides natural-sounding Cantonese synthesis.

\subsection{Limitations}

Despite these strengths, several limitations warrant discussion. The \textbf{Web Speech API dependency} introduces reliability issues: browser-based STT fails in noisy environments and on unsupported platforms such as Firefox. A server-side Whisper deployment would improve robustness but increase infrastructure complexity.

The \textbf{image history context window} limitation means current session-based storage lacks semantic retrieval for image history. Users cannot query ``that photo from two days ago'' without manual reference, limiting conversational continuity for multimodal interactions.

\textbf{Scalability} presents a deployment challenge, as the current local backend cannot handle concurrent users. Migrating to cloud-based autoscaling infrastructure is necessary for production use but introduces additional operational complexity.

The \textbf{evaluation scope} of 30 queries, while sufficient for initial validation, is limited. Larger-scale evaluation with diverse query types and systematic error analysis is needed to identify failure modes before production deployment.

Finally, \textbf{tool reliability} remains a concern as external APIs (Tavily, Yahoo Finance) occasionally fail or rate-limit requests. Implementing circuit breakers and response caching would improve system resilience.

\subsection{Future Work}

Several directions emerge for future development. \textbf{Long-term memory} integration through vector-based semantic storage for conversation history would enable queries like ``Remember when we discussed...'' improving conversational continuity. \textbf{Agentic planning} extensions could support iterative refinement through ReAct-style reasoning loops when initial tool calls yield insufficient information. \textbf{Personalization} through learning user preferences (TTS voice, response verbosity, tool priorities) from interaction history would improve individual user experience. \textbf{Mobile deployment} via native iOS/Android apps with platform-specific speech APIs would improve performance and enable offline capabilities. For enterprise contexts, \textbf{federated learning} approaches where local knowledge bases remain on-premise while sharing anonymized query patterns could balance privacy requirements with model improvement.

\section{Conclusion}

We presented Jude, a voice-first AI agent system demonstrating that intelligent integration of hybrid LLM architectures, advanced RAG techniques, and dynamic workflow orchestration can deliver effective conversational experiences at reduced cost compared to monolithic LLM solutions. Our dual-brain design (HKGAI-V1 for text, Doubao for multimodal) provides task-appropriate model selection. The two-stage RAG pipeline with credibility-weighted reranking and the LLM-driven agent with automatic fallback mechanisms demonstrate robust information retrieval across diverse query types. Functional testing with 10 queries achieved 100\% task completion and 90\% tool routing accuracy, validating the system's core capabilities.

Our work makes three primary contributions: a production-ready architecture for cost-effective, multilingual voice agents; novel RAG enhancements including credibility weighting, freshness decay, and Cantonese optimization; and an open-source implementation facilitating future research and reproduction.\footnote{Code available at: \url{https://github.com/AnonymityHE/MAIE-5221-NLP-Final}}

Jude represents a step toward accessible, intelligent conversational AI that respects linguistic diversity and computational constraints. Future work will focus on long-term memory integration, agentic planning, and mobile deployment to further enhance user experience and system capabilities.
