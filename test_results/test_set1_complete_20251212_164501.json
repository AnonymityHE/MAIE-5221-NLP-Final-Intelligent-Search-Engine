The main difference between them is the severity of the typhoon and the expected impact on Hong Kong. \n\nTyphoon warning signal No. 8 indicates that a typhoon is approaching Hong Kong and is expected to bring strong winds with sustained speeds of 63-117 km/h and gusts exceeding 180 km/h. This signal is issued when the typhoon is expected to have a significant impact on Hong Kong, causing disruption to transportation, businesses, and daily activities. \n\nOn the other hand, typhoon warning signal No. 10 is the highest level of typhoon warning and indicates that a typhoon is expected to bring extremely strong winds with sustained speeds exceeding 118 km/h and gusts exceeding 220 km/h. This signal is issued when the typhoon is expected to have a severe impact on Hong Kong, causing widespread damage and disruption. \n\nIn summary, the main difference between typhoon warning signal No. 8 and No. 10 is the severity of the typhoon and the expected impact on Hong Kong. No. 10 is a more severe warning than No. 8 and indicates that the typhoon is expected to be more destructive and disruptive.",
