Wind Speeds: \n   - No. 8 signal means gale or storm force winds are affecting the area.\n   - No. 10 signal indicates hurricane-force winds.\n\n3. Frequency of Issuance:\n   - No. 8 signals are issued more frequently (several times per typhoon season typically)\n   - No. 10 signals are rare, only issued for the most intense typhoons\n\n4. Impact:\n   - Both signals will cause suspension of normal activities (schools, businesses etc.)\n   - No. 10 signal causes more extensive damage and disruption to infrastructure and transportation\n   - No. 10 signal requires more stringent safety precautions\n\nThe Observatory typically issues warnings two hours in advance before hoisting the No. 8 signal. The No. 10 signal indicates the most extreme weather conditions and is only issued when a severe typhoon is directly impacting Hong Kong with its most dangerous quadrant.",
