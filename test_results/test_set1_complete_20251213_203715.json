        "answer": "Typhoon warning signals No. 8 and No. 10 are two different levels of typhoon warnings issued by the Hong Kong Observatory to inform the public about the severity of an approaching typhoon. The main differences between the two signals are the wind speeds and the potential impacts on the region.\n\n1. Typhoon warning signal No. 8: This signal indicates that gale or storm force winds are expected or blowing in Hong Kong, with sustained wind speeds of 63-117 km/h (39-73 mph) and gusts that may exceed 118 km/h (73 mph). During a No. 8 signal, people are advised to stay indoors, and public transportation services may be suspended or reduced. Schools and some businesses may also close.\n\n2. Typhoon warning signal No. 10: This is the highest level of typhoon warning and indicates that hurricane force winds are expected or blowing in Hong Kong, with sustained wind speeds of 118 km/h (73 mph) or more and gusts that may exceed 220 km/h (137 mph). During a No. 10 signal, the public is advised to stay in a safe place and avoid going outside, as the typhoon can cause severe damage to buildings and infrastructure. Most public transportation services, schools, and businesses will be closed during this time.\n\nIn summary, the main difference between a typhoon warning signal No. 8 and No. 10 is the intensity of the wind speeds and the potential impacts on the region, with No. 10 being the most severe and dangerous level of typhoon warning.",
